This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.
> App is using Expo version 0.18.25 with EXPO SDK 51.0.22.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start

# OR using npx
npx expo start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npx
npx expo start --localhost --android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npx
npx expo start --localhost --ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

### For Web

```bash
# using npx
npx expo start --localhost --web

# OR using Yarn
yarn web
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `_layout.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!
   Optional: You can edit `index.tsx` file to be able to redirect to log in, register, or splash screen in future. `index.tsx` file outputs the root of the website. Example: localhost:8081/

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

#Useful Resources

1. (tabs) folder indicates the TabScreens, but it is in parenthesis to avoid link to have tabs; Example: localhost:8081/tabs/home => /localhost:8081/home - gets rid of the tabs in-between.
2. [id] by default gets the foldername as path with the id, example `bills/[id].tsx/` will output on link localhost:8081/bills/10887923 which will display the data for the bill number/id 10887923.
